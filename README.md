# StudentDatabaseWithSQLite

## Project created by:

NAME: Diego Avena

Email: avena@chapman.edu

## Project description:

Creates a table from a spreadsheet, and allows the user to perform searches for students based on their major, GPA,
advisor, etc. Also allows the user to update student information, add new students into the table, and delete
students from the table.


## Instructions: 

To run, open main.py in pycharm, located in Code, and click the play button.

If you need an interpreter, configure one, making sure the python version is 3.8 or higher. You 
should not need any packages to be installed. Lower versions of python might work too, but this was 
the version the program was last ran in without issue.

1.) I wanted to use OOP in order to get a better organization
set up for the code, so in order to understand how to do this
in python, I used these sites:
